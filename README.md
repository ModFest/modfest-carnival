**ModFest: Carnival** was a mod development jam that ran from June 7th through June 24th, 2024.

This modpack contains all submissions, as well as a showcase world built by participants to show off their mods!

**Key Features**:
- Witness the dawn of 52 mods, including **Dancerizer**, **Ouch!**, **Splinecart**, and **Dream Burst Spirit Vector**!
- Explore a cozy river-valley peppered with mod "booths" all along the sweeping, figure-8 shaped path!
- Traverse the map on skates, coasters, and flying carpets - with jumps, blasts, wall runs, and a whole lot of style!
- Collect tokens and spend them to play ticket-awarding minigames and challenges, then spend tickets on prizes! 
- Find and earn 126 collectible "shards", tracking booth visits, hidden secrets, and tricky challenges!
- The circus isn't in town for long - go make some memories!
